# Using NVIDIA graphics card for specific application
# On GNOME systems (Xorg or Wayland display manager)
# On desktop entry of the App (e.g. /usr/share/applications/App.desktop) enter following line

PrefersNonDefaultGPU=true

# Log out of the system and log back in
# Launch App using the desktop launch icon
# Check with `nvidia-smi` your App should be listed under applications running under NVIDIA GPU
# If this does not work you will have to try to launch application with environment variables set in a certain way
# Create following wrapper script in system PATH and make it executable

#!/bin/sh
export __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1
export __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
exec MyApp

# Now change desktop entry's `Exec` line to point to the wrapper script instead
# Try logging out and back in and launching MyApp from desktop icon

# If you're on a terminal emulator (e.g. Kitty, Alacritty) launched with NVIDIA following command should show that

glxinfo | grep 'OpenGL'

# output has "NVIDIA" under "OpenGL vendor string" and "OpenGL renderer string"

# If it does not work or in a terminal emulator launched with in-build (shared) Intel graphics GPU command output
# shows "Intel ... graphics..." instead
